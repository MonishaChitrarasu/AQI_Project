# AQI_Project
To predict the AQI(Air Quality Index) value using machine learning algorithms and time series algorithms.

Dataset: Chennai dataset

What is AQI?
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is used for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you.

Machine Learning algorithms:
1. Multiple Linear Regression algorithm
2. Support vector machine algorithm
3. Decision Tree algorithm
4. Random Forest algorithm

Time Series algorithms:
1. Auto-Regressive Moving average(ARMA)
2. Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving average(ARIMA)
3. Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving average(SARIMA)
